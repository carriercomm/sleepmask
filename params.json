It maintains the state of grid buffers and\r\nprints them out in their entirety when they are updated; it\r\noutputs all line buffers as they are updated; it provides both\r\nline-based and character-based input (through the `/key <x>`\r\nmetacommand).\r\n\r\n## Sounds great!  How do I use it?\r\n\r\nInstall the required gems - yajl-ruby and the development version of\r\neventmachine.\r\n\r\nDownload and compile RemGlk - at the time of writing, you'll also\r\nneed the [save file name hack][savefile] to enable saving and\r\nloading.\r\n\r\nDownload and compile your favorite Glk-enabled IF interpreter\r\n(for instance, [Glulxe][glulxe], the Glulx reference interpreter)\r\nagainst RemGlk.\r\n\r\nEdit sleepmachine.rb to point it at the location of your\r\ninterpreter(s).\r\n\r\n(Get an appropriate story file - for instance, the venerable\r\n[Adventure][adventure] has `advent.ulx` available.)\r\n\r\nRun it:\r\n\r\n~~~~\r\nruby sleepmachine.rb --interpreter glulxe ../advent.ulx\r\n~~~~\r\n\r\nType commands normally. \r\n\r\nIf you use the commands `SAVE` or `RESTORE`, sleepmask will\r\nautomatically prompt you for a filename; if your game does not use\r\nthose commands for saving and restoring, you will need to type\r\n`/savename <filename>` before you attempt to save or restore to\r\ntell sleepmask what filename to use.\r\n\r\nIf you need to press a key (rather than enter a line of input),\r\nuse the `/key <key>` metacommand - any (non-whitespace) (latin-1) single\r\ncharacter, or one of the special character names:\r\n\r\nspace, left, right, up, down, return, delete, escape, tab, pageup,\r\npagedown, home, end, func1, func2, func3, func4, func5, func6,\r\nfunc7, func8, func9, func10, func11, func12\r\n\r\n`/quit` will quit the interpreter.\r\n\r\n## Known limitations\r\n\r\n* No differentiation between different line buffer windows.\r\n* No support for hyperlink input.\r\n* No way to query and interrogate the current state of grid\r\n  buffers that are not being updated.\r\n* Bad interpreter configuration support (currently hardcoded)\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 Justin de Vesine\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person\r\nobtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation\r\nfiles (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without\r\nrestriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy,\r\nmodify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies\r\nof the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\r\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\r\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
