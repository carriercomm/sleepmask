        <h2>RemGlk?</h2>

<p>The CheapGlk <a href="http://eblong.com/zarf/glk/index.html">Glk</a> library allows playing interactive fiction
through a dumb terminal interface, such as IRC or a chat server,
without the need for cursor positioning and similar;
unfortunately, it has the significant lack that it cannot handle
anything but a single buffer output window; no status bars,
multiple windows, or any of the other fancy things that the Glk
standard is capable of handling.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/erkyrath/remglk">RemGlk</a> is a Glk library that, rather than displaying to
a screen or console, handles input and output via JSON-serialized
events.</p>

<h2>So how does that help with CheapGlk?</h2>

<p>Sleepmask seeks to bridge the gap between dumb terminals and
full-featured IF by wrapping up RemGlk in a human-friendly dumb
terminal interface. It maintains the state of grid buffers and
prints them out in their entirety when they are updated; it
outputs all line buffers as they are updated; it provides both
line-based and character-based input (through the <code>/key &lt;x&gt;</code>
metacommand).</p>

<h2>Sounds great!  How do I use it?</h2>

<p>Install the required gems - yajl-ruby and the development version of
eventmachine.</p>

<p>Download and compile RemGlk - at the time of writing, you'll also
need the <a href="https://github.com/erkyrath/remglk/issues/1">save file name hack</a> to enable saving and
loading.</p>

<p>Download and compile your favorite Glk-enabled IF interpreter
(for instance, <a href="https://github.com/erkyrath/glulxe">Glulxe</a>, the Glulx reference interpreter)
against RemGlk.</p>

<p>Edit sleepmachine.rb to point it at the location of your
interpreter(s).</p>

<p>(Get an appropriate story file - for instance, the venerable
<a href="http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=fft6pu91j85y4acv">Adventure</a> has <code>advent.ulx</code> available.)</p>

<p>Run it:</p>

<pre><code>ruby sleepmachine.rb --interpreter glulxe ../advent.ulx
</code></pre>

<p>Type commands normally. </p>

<p>If you use the commands <code>SAVE</code> or <code>RESTORE</code>, sleepmask will
automatically prompt you for a filename; if your game does not use
those commands for saving and restoring, you will need to type
<code>/savename &lt;filename&gt;</code> before you attempt to save or restore to
tell sleepmask what filename to use.</p>

<p>If you need to press a key (rather than enter a line of input),
use the <code>/key &lt;key&gt;</code> metacommand - any (non-whitespace) (latin-1) single
character, or one of the special character names:</p>

<p>space, left, right, up, down, return, delete, escape, tab, pageup,
pagedown, home, end, func1, func2, func3, func4, func5, func6,
func7, func8, func9, func10, func11, func12</p>

<p><code>/quit</code> will quit the interpreter.</p>

<h2>Known limitations</h2>

<ul>
<li>No differentiation between different line buffer windows.</li>
<li>No support for hyperlink input.</li>
<li>No way to query and interrogate the current state of grid
buffers that are not being updated.</li>
<li>Bad interpreter configuration support (currently hardcoded)</li>
